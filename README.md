👋 Hi, I’m @Smith-at-Forge  
👀 I’m interested in AI, graphic design and web/app development.  
🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development. So far, I’ve finished the frontend portion, covering:
- Intermediate level in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Responsive design using Flexbox and Grid systems
- Bootstrap framework and jQuery library
- A Web Design Masterclass  

My next step is to master backend technologies. You can follow my learning journey and check out my projects here:

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller-scale projects to gain hands-on experience in development or cybersecurity.  
⚡ Fun fact: My hobby is collecting "Hello World" programs in every programming language imaginable.  

📫 How to reach me: Contact details are available on my website above. Feel free to get in touch!
