👋 Hi, I’m @Smith-at-Forge  
👀 I’m interested in AI, graphic design and web/app development.  
🌱 I’m currently learning web development. So far, I've completed:

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller-scale projects to gain hands-on experience in development or cybersecurity.  
⚡ Fun fact: My hobby is collecting "Hello World" programs in every programming language imaginable.
